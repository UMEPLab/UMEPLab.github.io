Our team achieved third place at the Urban Cup finals held in Bali. Building on our first-place result in Track 2 of the preliminaries, we showcased our mobility agent system integrating human-centered planning heuristics with reinforcement learning for urban environments.

Key points:

- Presented agent-based mobility scenarios across varied urban contexts
- Demonstrated robustness under peak-hour demand and network disruptions
- Shared open tools and datasets for reproducibility

We thank the organizers and partners for their support, and we look forward to continued collaboration on open, reproducible urban AI research.
