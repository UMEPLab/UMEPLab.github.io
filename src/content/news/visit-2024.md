Representatives from the Guangzhou Urban Planning & Design Survey Research Institute visited the UMEP Lab for a technical exchange. The discussion covered transport equity, travel resilience, and how micromobility interacts with the built environment.

Discussion topics:

- Equity metrics and neighborhood-level accessibility
