This comprehensive study examines the role of green infrastructure in reducing urban heat island effects. Our research spans multiple climate zones and provides actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers.

## Key Findings

- Green roofs can reduce local temperatures by up to 5Â°C
- Urban forests show the highest cooling potential
- Implementation costs vary significantly by region

## Methodology

We employed a mixed-methods approach combining:
- Satellite temperature analysis
- Ground-based measurements
- Economic impact assessment
