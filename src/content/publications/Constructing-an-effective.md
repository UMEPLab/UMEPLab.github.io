abstract: "Urban green spaces (UGSs) contribute significantly to public health and well-being. However, research on urban park resilience during the pandemic remains scarce. Studies on the impact of the pandemic on green space usage have mostly focused on spatial distribution using cross-sectional data, thus neglecting changes from a “resilience” perspective. Additionally, current methods based on mobile signal data often overestimate exposure by including non-use behaviors, which can lead to the misjudgment of usage behavior. This study constructs an effective green space exposure (EGSE) index based on mobile signal data, integrating precise UGS spatial boundaries and reasonably setting stay duration. An innovative resilience index is also proposed by combining annual variation rates. This approach allows for a systematic analysis of resilience changes in Guangzhou’s 269 UGSs across the pre-pandemic (2019), early pandemic (2020), and post-pandemic (2022) periods. The key findings are as follows. Regarding spatiotemporal heterogeneity, central urban areas demonstrated pronounced vulnerability, with EGSE surging significantly during weekends in the post-pandemic period. Concerning park-type heterogeneity, visitation patterns shifted from the predominant use of small-scale “community parks” and “recreational parks” in the early pandemic stage to a markedly increased utilization of “comprehensive parks” during post-pandemic recovery. In terms of demographic group heterogeneity, vulnerable groups’ EGSE sharply declined during the early pandemic and showed sluggish recovery. Regarding EGSE inequality, significant disparities emerged between weekdays and weekends during post-pandemic phases. This study presents a resilience analysis framework and exposure index that offer actionable recommendations for governments to plan and allocate UGSs in densely populated areas."
