abstract: "Along with the rise of the sharing economy, recent years have seen a novel type of shared micro-mobility, shared electric bikes (e-bikes), emerge in various cities and regions worldwide. Although shared e-bikes play a more and more critical role in daily city life, it is unclear what contributes to the usage of shared e-bike. This study aims to reveal what characteristics of cities are linked to the prevalence of e-bike sharing, and how the city-level factors affect the utilisation of e-bike sharing. We find that high tertiary industry ratios and high employment density of cities are correlated to the prevalence and utilisation efficiency of e-bike sharing. Cities with complex terrain and poor public transport systems have high usage frequencies. In addition, e-bike sharing can overcome the obstacles of complicated terrain and promote travel in less developed cities. This could provide a feasible clue to arranging the shared e-bike and promote the sustainable development of transportation."
