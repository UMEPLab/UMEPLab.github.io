abstract: "This paper investigates whether shared electric bikes (e-bikes) complement or substitute traditional bike sharing. Using bi-monthly panel data from Chengdu (2020â€“2021), the study applies nearest-neighbour matching and dynamic difference-in-differences methods. Results show that the effect of e-bike sharing initially acted as a complement but later became a substitute, leading to a 22.6% reduction in bike-sharing trips while overall shared cycling increased by 65.9%. The findings suggest that although e-bikes eventually replace some traditional bike usage, they significantly expand the overall micro-mobility market and promote sustainable transportation."
